## Core Concept: Recursion
A recursive function is a function that is defined iteratively referencing itself until you arrive at a pre-specified stopping point. The factorial function is a recursive function because the the factorial of an integer n, is n times the factorial of n-1. The function repeats until n = 1 (or 0 if you want). See the script play.py. You can also define the fibonacci sequence recursively.  Recursion may actually slow down your application, but it is sometimes simpler to use or necessary. See th book Grocking Algorithms.
