PyPI (Pronounced like "Pie P.I.")houses thousands packages for all sorts of tasks. Sometimes people refer to PyPI as "PyPy" but this can create confusion because there is an implementation of Python called PyPy. Sometimes people refer to it as the "Cheese Shop" referencing  Monty Python.
PyPI can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi.

pip allows you to get packages from pypi and their dependencies.
