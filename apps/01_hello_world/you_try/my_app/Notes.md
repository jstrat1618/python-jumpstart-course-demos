# Hello World App
This app asks the user for his/her name then prints a greeting.
## Core Concepts
### Calling Functions
Functions are called with parentheses and the parameters in the paraentheses.
e.g. 
print("Hello, World!") 
main()
No semicolon is required.

### Variables
Python is weakly typed, meaning you don't have to specify the type of variable. 
e.g. 
x = 4 
x += 1 #Adds 1 to x
y = "Hello, World!"

#### Note
By convention python variables are typically named with underscores. 
e.g. user_text not camel casing userText
